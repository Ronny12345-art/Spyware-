# Spyware
This is a spyware which does keylogging and screenshots 10 minutes every 3 hours and sends them to an email by its default configurations . it is made only using python and you must edit the codes and put your email and its app password .
what you must edit in the codes : 
  1. remove my email in the codes and put yours
  2. remove my email app password in the codes and put yours
  3. edit the configurations as you want(by default the codes does keylogging and takes screenshots 10 minutes every 3 hours and sends them to an email). you can even configure the codes to       record 24hours/24hours (meaning a whole day)
  4. you must find an icon and use pyinstaller to make the codes into a .exe so that it looks harmless and then put it to the victim's laptop or desktop
  5. by default this source codes runs at every victim's laptop or desktop startup but sometimes it doesnt work according to the environment , so the only trusted way that it will work 100%      is to trigger it using task scheduler .
